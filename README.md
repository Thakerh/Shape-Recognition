# Shape-Recognition

Just a scratch to shape recognition. My code can recognize 5 shapes which are Triangle, square, rectangle, pentagon, and star from the image provided.


The approach is shape-bases and works towards recognition under a range of circumstances. The main emphasis is on its neural elements that allow the system to learn to recognize objects about which it has prior information. To make the system complete, a full account is given of the necessary image processing techniques that are applies to the image to make recognition possible. These techniques include the extraction of shapes from image and the creation of descriptors that overcome difficulties of affine transformations. The simple reflex agent is very much important as it reacts on the base of the environment and its actions are based on pre determined rules, for verifying shapes we have already determined the rule which are the dimensions of the shape. Once the agent scans the environment which is the image provided to the code it will look for rule and determine which shape is in the Image.
